Naming checks
-------------

It is useful when checks follow a consinstent naming. Think about an item on
a checklist where you can put a checkmark in front of it when the check is
done successfully without finding an issue. So the name should not resemble
an advice, but the result of the advice. Here are a few examples to indicate
how the naming should be done:

========================== ===========================
Bad naming                 Good (can be "checked off")
========================== ===========================
``PEP8Compliance``         ``IsPEP8Compliant``
``CheckForLongParagraphs`` ``HasNoLongParagraphs``
``DontUsePassiveVoice``    ``NoPassiveVoiceUsed``
========================== ===========================
